Quinidine sulfate exerts its anti-malarial activity by acting primarily as an intra-erythrocytic schizonticide through association with the hemepolymer (hemozoin) in the acidic food vacuole of the parasite thereby preventing further polymerization by heme polymerase enzyme. This results in accumulation of toxic heme and death of the parasite. Quinidine sulfate exerts its antiarrhythmic effects by depressing the flow of sodium ions into cells during phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, thereby slowing the impulse conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, reducing the rate of phase 0 depolarization and prolonging the refractory period. Quinidine sulfate also reduces the slope of phase 4 depolarization in Purkinje-fibres resulting in slowed conduction and reduced automaticity in the heart. Quinidine is an alkaloid extracted from the bark of the Cinchona tree with class 1A antiarrhythmic and antimalarial effects. Quinidine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by binding to and inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby inhibiting the sodium influx required for the initiation and conduction of impulses resulting in an increase of the threshold for excitation and decreased depolarization during phase 0 of the action potential. In addition, the effective refractory period (ERP), action potential duration (APD), and ERP/APD ratios are increased, resulting in decreased conduction velocity of nerve impulses. Quinidine exerts its antimalarial activity by acting primarily as an intra-erythrocytic schizonticide through association with the heme polymer (hemazoin) in the acidic food vacuole of the parasite thereby preventing further polymerization by heme polymerase enzyme. This results in accumulation of toxic heme and death of the parasite.

In combination with [DB13878], glecaprevir is a useful therapy for patients who experienced therapeutic failure from other NS3/4A protease inhibitors. It demonstrates a high genetic barrier against resistance mutations of the virus. In cell cultures, the emergence of amino acid substitutions at NS3 resistance-associated positions A156 or D/Q168 in HCV genotype 1a, 2a or 3a replicons led to reduced susceptibility to glecaprevir. The combinations of amino acid substitutions at NS3 position Y65H and D/Q168 also results in greater reductions in glecaprevir susceptibility, and NS3 Q80R in genotype 3a patients also leads to glecaprevir resistance.   it is available as an oral combination therapy with [DB13878] under the brand name Mavyret. This fixed-dose combination therapy was FDA-approved in August 2017 to treat adults with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1-6 without cirrhosis (liver disease) or with mild cirrhosis, including patients with moderate to severe kidney disease and those who are on dialysis. Mavyret is also indicated for HCV genotype 1-infected patients who have been previously treated with regimens either containing an NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. Hepatitis C viral infection often leads to decreased liver function and subsequent liver failure, causing a significantly negative impact on the patients' quality of life. The ultimate goal of the combination treatment is to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) and cure the patients from the infection.

CC(CCCC(C)(C)O)C1CCC2C1(CCCC2=CC=C3CC(CCC3=C)O)C	Calcifediol is an orally available synthetic form of the calcitriol prohormone calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D), which can be used for vitamin D supplementation, and with potential immunomodulating activity. Upon oral administration, calcifediol is taken up by the body and converted, in the kidneys, to the active form calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or 1,25(OH)2D). This form increases and normalizes vitamin D plasma levels, which, in turn, regulates calcium plasma levels, and normalizes elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels by suppressing both PTH synthesis, and secretion. Vitamin D modulates and enhances the innate and adaptive immune responses. This may improve unregulated inflammation and prevents the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Specifically, vitamin D binds to its receptor vitamin D receptor (VDR) which is widely expressed on immune cells and epithelial cells. This stimulates neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, and activates epithelial cells to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In addition, upon infection, vitamin D promotes the migration of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) to lymphoid organs where they activate B- and T-lymphocytes.

Gemifloxacin has been linked to rare instances of acute liver injury. Gemifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic with antimicrobial property. Gemifloxacin enters bacterial cells by diffusion through integral membrane porin pathway before targeting both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, two enzymes critical for DNA replication and repair. This agent binds to the DNA/DNA-gyrase complex and inhibits the A subunits of the enzyme thereby preventing the bacterial chromosome from rejoining. This interferes with DNA replication and repair processes as well as transcription, and ultimately leads to bacterial cell death. Gemifloxacin targets at both Gram-positive, -negative and atypical human pathogens.

Decreased plasma fluctuations of it due to attenuated metabolism may explain a lower incidence of adverse reactions associated with it. it is a racemic mixture containing  RR-it and SS-it.   Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and neuropsychiatric disturbances that interfere with daily functioning and significantly reduce the quality of life. The most prominent physical symptom of HD that may increase the risk of injury is chorea, which is an involuntary, sudden movement that can affect any muscle and flow randomly across body regions. Psychomotor symptoms of HD, such as chorea, are related to hyperactive dopaminergic neurotransmission. it depletes the levels of presynaptic dopamine by blocking VMAT2, which is responsible for the uptake of dopamine into synaptic vesicles in monoaminergic neurons and exocytotic release. As with other agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, it is a drug to alleviate the motor symptoms of HD and is not proposed to halt the progression of the disease. In clinical trials of patients with HD, 12 weeks of treatment of it resulted in overall improvement in mean total maximal chorea scores and motor signs than placebo.

PCBs are either oily liquids or solids that are colorless to light yellow. Some PCBs can exist as a vapor in air. PCBs have no known smell or taste. Many commercial PCB mixtures are known in the U. S. by the trade name Aroclor. PCBs have been used as coolants and lubricants in transformers, capacitors, and other electrical equipment because they don't burn easily and are good insulators. The manufacture of PCBs was stopped in the U. S. in 1977 because of evidence they build up in the environment and can cause harmful health effects. Products made before 1977 that may contain PCBs include old fluorescent lighting fixtures and electrical devices containing PCB capacitors, and old microscope and hydraulic oils.

Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approved it-pqpz in May 2018 for the treatment of adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Phenylketonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) and affects about 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 people in the United States. PAH deficiency and inability to break down an amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) leads to elevated blood phenylalanine concentrations and accumulation of neurotoxic Phe in the brain, causing chronic intellectual, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disabilities if untreated. Individuals with PKU also need to be under a strictly restricted diet as Phe is present in foods and products with high-intensity sweeteners. The primary goal of lifelong treatment of PKU, as recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, is to maintain blood Phe concentration in the range of 120 Âµmol/L to 3690 Âµmol/L. it-pqpz, or PEGylated it, is used as a novel enzyme substitution therapy and is marketed as Palynziq for subcutanoues injection. It is advantageous over currently available management therapies for PKU, such as [DB00360], that are ineffective to many patients due to long-term adherence issues or inadequate Phe-lowering effects. The presence of a PEG moiety in it-pqpz allows a reduced immune response and improved pharmacodynamic stability.

CC(CC1=CC=C(C=C1)O)(C(=O)O)N	Racemetyrosine is a dysfunctional and modified form of the non-essential amino acid tyrosine and an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; tyrosine 3-monooxygenase), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, racemetyrosine is specifically taken up by cancer cells through the transporter L-amino acid transferase-1 (LAT1; CD98). As a tyrosine derivative and faulty amino acid protein building block, racemetyrosine prevents protein synthesis in cancer cells. Specifically, this prevents mucin-1 (MUC1) protein synthesis. MUC1 is highly overexpressed by most cancer cells and regulates the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells created from the altered metabolism that cancer cells utilize, by upregulating key antioxidant defenses and preventing ROS-mediated apoptosis. In the absence of MUC1, ROS levels are increased, leading to an increase in oxidative stress, and induction of apoptosis. Also, being a protective transmembrane protein, MUC1 is part of the protective layer on the outside of cancer cells and plays a key role in shielding the cancer cell from the immune system. The loss of MUC1 compromises the cell membrane, thereby making the cancer cell more vulnerable to be recognized and attacked by the immune system. Normal cells do not regularly take up certain non-essential amino acids, such as tyrosine, but readily convert phenylalanine to tyrosine, so normal healthy cells are not expected to consume racemetyrosine. In addition, racemetyrosine competes with tyrosine at the tyrosine-binding site of TH, thereby inhibiting TH, an enzyme that activates molecular oxygen to catalyze the hydroxylation of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa), which is an intermediate to catecholamine (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) production. This inhibits the synthesis of catecholamines.

Upon administration, it specifically targets, binds to and prevents the activation of DHODH. This prevents the fourth enzymatic step in de novo pyrimidine synthesis, leading to inhibition of transcriptional elongation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in activated lymphocytes. DHODH inhibition also leads to metabolic stress in activated lymphocytes and inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-17 (IL-17A and IL-17F) and interferon-gamma (IFNg), thereby reducing inflammation. In addition, DHODH inhibition may lead to host-based anti-viral activity against many viruses. DHODH, a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotate, is a key enzyme in pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis.

As of October 31, 2017 the FDA approved Astra Zeneca's orally administered it (it). This Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, and in adult patients with Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) who have already received at least one prior therapy.  Also known as it, it is also considered a second generation BTK inhibitor because it was rationally designed to be more potent and selective than ibrutinib, theoretically expected to demonstrate fewer adverse effects owing to minimized bystander effects on targets other than BTK.  Nevertheless, it was approved under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway, which is based upon overall response rate and faciliates earlier approval of medicines that treat serious conditions or/and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. Continued approval for it's currently accepted indication may subsequently be contingent upon ongoing verification and description of clinical benefit in confimatory trials.  Furthermore, the FDA granted this medication Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations. It also received Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. At this time, more than 35 clinical trials across 40 countries with more than 2500 patients are underway or have been completed with regards to further research into better understanding and expanding the therapeutic uses of it. it is an orally available inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it inhibits the activity of BTK and prevents the activation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. This prevents both B-cell activation and BTK-mediated activation of downstream survival pathways. This leads to an inhibition of the growth of malignant B cells that overexpress BTK. BTK, a member of the src-related BTK/Tec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in B-cell malignancies; it plays an important role in B lymphocyte development, activation, signaling, proliferation and survival.

PI3K-alpha Inhibitor MEN1611 is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the class I phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), with potential antineoplastic activity. PI3K alpha inhibitor MEN1611 selectively binds to and inhibits PIK3CA and its mutated forms in the PI3K/Akt (protein kinase B)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. This results in both apoptosis and growth inhibition in PIK3CA-expressing tumor cells. By specifically targeting PIK3CA, this agent may be more efficacious and less toxic than pan-PI3K inhibitors. In addition, MEN1611 also targets mutated forms of PI3K gamma (PI3Kg). MEN1611 may stimulate the immune system to restore CD8+ T-cell activation and cytotoxicity. Dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is often found in solid tumors and results in the promotion of tumor cell growth, survival, and resistance to chemo- and radio-therapy.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the peripheral joints. It is characterized by synovial inflammation and hyperplasia, autoantibody production, cartilage damage and bone destruction, leading to co-morbidities. Despite a variety of therapeutic agents available for treatment, up to 40% of the patients do not respond to current therapies, including biological therapies. The etiology of the disease is mostly unknown; however, the role of JAK as a driver of immune-mediated conditions was discovered, leading to the use of JAK as therapeutic targets for rheumatoid arthritis. To reduce dose-related toxicity (as seen with some pan-JAK inhibitors) without significantly affecting efficacy, more selective JAK1 inhibitors, it and [filgotinib], were developed.  The FDA approved it in August 2019 for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate.

Upon administration of it the vorinostat moiety targets and binds to HDACs. This leads to an accumulation of highly acetylated histones, which results in an induction of chromatin remodeling, a modulation of gene expression, an inhibition of tumor cell division and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. The bendamustine moiety binds to, alkylates and crosslinks macromolecules, inhibiting DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, which also results in tumor cell apoptosis. Thus, it shows superior efficacy compared to the activity of either agent alone. In addition, the inhibition of HDAC6 activity by it induces the activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1), the key regulatory protein for the unfolded protein response (UPR). Induction of the UPR increases the sensitivity of certain cancer cell types to certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as proteasome inhibitors. Therefore, it may work synergistically with proteasome inhibitors. HDACs, enzymes that deacetylate chromatin histone proteins, are overexpressed in various cancers and play a key role in proliferation and resistance of tumor cells.

CCCC1=CC(=C(C(=C1)O)[C@@H]2C=C(CC[C@H]2C(=C)C)C)O	it, also known as it or it, is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found within [DB14009]. It is one of over 100 cannabinoids identified from the Cannabis plant that can modulate the physiological activity of cannabis, or marijuana. Compared to its homolog, [DB09061], it is shortened by two methyl (CH2) groups on its side chain. Notably, both [DB09061] and it have demonstrated anticonvulsant activity in animal and human models and are demonstrating promising clinical trial results. Other cannabinoids with some evidence of anti-epileptic activity include [DB11755] (THCV) and Î9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid.  While the primary components of cannabis, CBD and THC, have been shown to modulate many of their physiological effects through their binding to the cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, the investigational cannabinoids with anticonvulsant action mostly use mechanisms that do not involve these two endocannabinoid receptors.  The anti-epileptic activity of CBD and it is thought to be modulated by their effects on transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1  (TRPV1), also known as the capsaicin receptor, which is a member of a large family of ion channels that are involved in the onset and progression of several types of epilepsy. CBD and it have been shown to dose-dependently activate and then desensitize TRPV1 as well as TRPV2 and TRPA1 channels. Desensitization of these ion channels is a potential mechanism by which these molecules cause a reduction of neuronal hyperexcitability that contributes to epileptic activity and seizures.   it has also been shown to inhibit the activity of diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase-Î±, the primary enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). The clinical implications of this are unclear however, as this interaction has not been shown to affect it's anticonvulsant activity.  it is being actively developed by GW Pharmaceuticals as the experimental compound GWP42006 as it has \

CCCC1=CC(=C2[C@@H]3C=C(CC[C@H]3C(OC2=C1)(C)C)C)O	it (it) is a propyl analogue of tetrahydrocannabinol (Î9-THC), one of the primary pharmacological components of [Medical Cannabis]. Î9-THC is currently available in several synthetic forms, including [Dronabinol], while purified or isolated it is not approved for any medical uses and is not available as any marketed products. As a major phytocannabinoid, however, it is accessible within [Medical Cannabis] along with other identified cannabinoids including [Cannabidiol] (CBD), [cannabinol] (CBN), [cannabigerol] (CBG), [cannabichromene] (CBC), [cannabivarin] (CBV), and [Cannabidivarin] (CBDV).   it is one of four cannabinoids with identified potential as anticonvulsant agents, which also includes Î9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, [Cannabidiol] (CBD), and [Cannabidivarin] (CBDV).  Although it possesses an almost identical structure to Î9-THC (varying only by the length of its lipophilic alkyl chain), it has different molecular targets and pharmacological profile. Compared to THC which demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity of both endocannabinoid receptors Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R), it acts as a CB1 antagonist and a partial agonist of CB2. Further evidence has also shown that it acts as an agonist of GPR55 and l-Î±-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). Beyond the endocannabinoid system, it has also been reported to activate 5HT1A receptors to produce an antipsychotic effect that has therapeutic potential for ameliorating some of the negative, cognitive and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Furthermore, it interacts with different transient receptor potential (TRP) channels including TRPV2, which may contribute to the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects of cannabinoids and Cannabis extracts. It has also shown antiepileptiform and anticonvulsant properties, that suggest possible therapeutic application in the treatment of pathophysiologic hyperexcitability states such as untreatable epilepsy.  Cannabinoid receptors are utilized endogenously by the body through the endocannabinoid system, which includes a group of lipid proteins, enzymes, and receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. Through its modulation of neurotransmitter release, the endocannabinoid system regulates cognition, pain sensation, appetite, memory, sleep, immune function, and mood among many others. These effects are largely mediated through two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2). CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with the majority of receptors localized to the hippocampus and amygdala of the brain. Physiological effects of using cannabis make sense in the context of its receptor activity as the hippocampus and amygdala are primarily involved with regulation of memory, fear, and emotion. In contrast, CB2 receptors are mainly found peripherally in immune cells, lymphoid tissue, and peripheral nerve terminals.  Reliably studying the effects of Cannabis (and of it) is complicated by the numerous other compounds that Cannabis contains such as terpenes, flavonoids, phenols, amino acids, and fatty acids among many others that have the potential to modulate the plant's pharmacological effect.

It is a N-sulfonylurea and a member of monochlorobenzenes. it is a sulfonamide urea derivative with antihyperglycemic activity that can potentially be used to decrease cerebral edema. Upon administration, it binds to and blocks the sulfonylurea receptor type 1 (SUR1) subunit of the ATP-sensitive inwardly-rectifying potassium (K(ATP)) channels on the membranes of pancreatic beta cells. This prevents the inward current flow of positively charged potassium (K+) ions into the cell, and induces a calcium ion (Ca2+) influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, which triggers exocytosis of insulin-containing granules. In addition, it also inhibits the SUR1-regulated nonselective cation (NC) Ca-ATP channel, melastatin 4 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4; (TRPM4)), thereby preventing capillary failure and brain swelling. SUR1-TRPM4 channels are formed by co-assembly of SUR1 with TRPM4 in neurons, astrocytes, and capillary endothelium during cerebral ischemia. Upon ischemia-induced ATP depletion, channels open which results in sodium influx, cytotoxic edema formation, capillary fragmentation and necrotic cell death. SUR1-TRPM4 is not expressed in normal, uninjured tissues.

Defibrotide is used in patients with severe liver injury and has not been associated with worsening of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent, idiosyncratic liver injury. it is a polydeoxyribonucleotide with antithrombotic, thrombolytic, and fibrinolytic properties. Defibrotide induces the release of prostaglandin 12 and reduces the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, thereby interfering with platelet and leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. (NCI04) Defibrotide is a mixture of single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from the intestinal mucosa of pigs, with anti-thrombotic, thrombolytic, and fibrinolytic activities. Upon administration, and although the exact mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated, defibrotide induces the release of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), E2 (PGE2), and prostacyclin and reduces the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells. This relaxes the smooth muscle of blood vessels and prevents platelets from adhering to each other and to the endothelium. This protects the endothelium lining bloods vessels. Defibrotide increases tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and decreases plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity. This increases the activity of plasmin, prevents blood clot formation and dissolves blood clots.

CC(C)(C(=O)N[C@H](CC1=CNC2=CC=CC=C21)C(=O)N[C@H](CC3=CNC4=CC=CC=C43)NC=O)N	it, a novel and orally active ghrelin mimetic that stimulates GH secretion, is used in the diagnosis of adult GH deficiency (AGHD). More specifically, it is a peptidomimetic growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) that acts as an agonist of GH secretagogue receptor, or ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) to dose-dependently increase GH levels. Growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) represent a new class of pharmacological agents which have the potential to be used in numerous clinical applications. They include treatment for growth retardation in children and cachexia associated with chronic disease such as AIDS and cancer.   Growth hormone (GH) is classically linked with linear growth during childhood. In deficiency of this hormone, AGHD is commonly associated with increased fat mass (particularly in the abdominal region), decreased lean body mass, osteopenia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and/or glucose intolerance overtime. In addition, individuals with may be susceptible to cardiovascular complications from altered structures and function. Risk factors of AGHD include a history of childhood-onset GH deficiency or with hypothalamic/pituitary disease, surgery, or irradiation to these areas, head trauma, or evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies. While there are various therapies available such as GH replacement therapy, the absence of panhypopituitarism and low serum IGF-I levels with nonspecific clinical symptoms pose challenges to the detection and diagnosis of AGHD. The diagnosis of AGHD requires biochemical confirmation with at least 1 GH stimulation test. it is clinically useful since it displays good stability and oral bioavailability with comparable affinity to ghrelin receptor as its endogenous ligand. In clinical studies involving healthy subjects, it stimulated GH release in a dose-dependent manner with good tolerability.  it, developed by Aeterna Zentaris, was approved by the FDA in December 2017 under the market name Macrilen for oral solution. it is an orally available synthetic mimetic of the growth hormone (GH) secretagogue ghrelin with potential anti-cachexia activity. Upon oral administration, it mimics endogenous ghrelin by stimulating appetite and binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor GHSR in the central nervous system, thereby mimicking the GH-releasing effects of ghrelin from the pituitary gland. Stimulation of GH secretion increases insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels which may further stimulate protein synthesis. In addition, ghrelin reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may play a direct role in cancer-related loss of appetite.

Quinine has many mechanisms of action, including reduction of oxygen intake and carbohydrate metabolism; disruption of DNA replication and transcription via DNA intercalation; and reduction of the excitability of muscle fibers via alteration of calcium distribution. This agent also inhibits the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein which is overexpressed in multi-drug resistant tumors and may improve the efficacy of some antineoplastic agents. (NCI04) Quinidine is an alkaloid extracted from the bark of the Cinchona tree with class 1A antiarrhythmic and antimalarial effects. Quinidine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by binding to and inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby inhibiting the sodium influx required for the initiation and conduction of impulses resulting in an increase of the threshold for excitation and decreased depolarization during phase 0 of the action potential. In addition, the effective refractory period (ERP), action potential duration (APD), and ERP/APD ratios are increased, resulting in decreased conduction velocity of nerve impulses. Quinidine exerts its antimalarial activity by acting primarily as an intra-erythrocytic schizonticide through association with the heme polymer (hemazoin) in the acidic food vacuole of the parasite thereby preventing further polymerization by heme polymerase enzyme. This results in accumulation of toxic heme and death of the parasite.

Estradiol is the most potent form of all mammalian estrogenic steroids and acts as the major female sex hormone. As a pro-drug of estradiol, estradiol benzoate therefore has the same downstream effects within the body through binding to the Estrogen Receptor (ER) including ERÎ± and ERÎ² subtypes, which are located in various tissues including in the breasts, uterus, ovaries, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain.  Estradiol is commonly produced with an ester side-chain as endogenous estradiol has very low oral bioavailability on its own (2-10%). First-pass metabolism by the gut and the liver quickly degrades the estradiol molecule before it gets a chance to enter systemic circulation and exert its estrogenic effects. Esterification of estradiol aims to improves absorption and bioavailability after oral administration (such as with Estradiol valerate) or to sustain release from depot intramuscular injections (such as with Estradiol Cypionate) through improved lipophilicity. Following absorption, the esters are cleaved, resulting in the release of endogenous estradiol, or 17Î²-estradiol. Ester pro-drugs of estradiol are therefore considered to be bioidentical forms of estrogen.  it is not currently available in any commercially available products in Canada or the US.

It derives from a methanol and a fumaric acid. it is an orally bioavailable methyl ester of fumaric acid and activator of nuclear factor erythroid 2 [NF-E2]-related factor 2 (Nrf2, Nfe2l2), with potential neuroprotective, immunomodulating and radiosensitizing activities. Although the exact mechanism of action through which it exerts its neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects have yet to be fully understood, upon oral administration, it is converted into its active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF) and MMF binds to Nrf2. Subsequently, Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE). This induces the expression of a number of cytoprotective genes, including NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), sulfiredoxin 1 (Srxn1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO1, HMOX1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), thioredoxin reductase-1 (TXNRD1), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc) and glutamate-cysteine ligase regulatory subunit (Gclm); this also increases the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). The intraneuronal synthesis of GSH may protect neuronal cells from damage due to oxidative stress. it also appears to inhibit the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB)-mediated pathway, modulates the production of certain cytokines and induces apoptosis in certain T-cell subsets. Its radiosensitizing activity is due to this agent's ability to bind to and sequester intracellular GSH, thereby depleting intracellular GSH and preventing its anti-oxidative effects. This enhances the cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation in hypoxic cancer cells. Nrf2, a leucine zipper transcription factor, plays a key role in redox homeostasis and cytoprotection against oxidative stress.

Since it has multiple therapeutic activities there are several proposed mechanisms of action for this agent. The anti-inflammatory effects of this agent appear to be related to the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production by macrophages. This agent may activate the NO/cyclic GMP pathway and inhibit both the phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLC gamma2)/protein kinase C (PKC) and PI3K/AKT-MAPK signaling pathways in activated platelets to inhibit platelet aggregation. In activated platelets, these three signaling pathways are downstream of integrin activation mediated by collagen binding and influence the association of fibrinogen with its receptors. Additionally, it may exert its anti-cancer activity through the induction of cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and the stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation and activation. These processes could result in decreased proliferation of and increased immunocytotoxicity against tumor cells.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients.   it exerts its antiviral action by reversibly binding and inhibiting the NS3/4A serine protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Following viral replication of HCV genetic material and translation into a single polypeptide, Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) and its activating cofactor Nonstructural Protein 4A (NS4A) are responsible for cleaving genetic material into the following structural and nonstructural proteins required for assembly into mature virus: NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, it therefore prevents viral replication and function. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as it.   it has been available since July 2017 in a fixed dose combination product with [sofosbuvir] and [velpatasvir] as the commercially available product Vosevi. Vosevi is approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic HCV infection with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection. Notably, Vosevi is approved for use in patients with genotypes 1-6 who have been previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor, or patients with genotypes 1a or 3 infection and have previously been treated with an HCV regimen containing sofosbuvir without an NS5A inhibitor. Prior to Vosevi, there were no approved retreatment options for patients who have previously received, and failed, a regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor for treatment of chronic HCV infection. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein 3/non-structural protein 4A (NS3/NS4A) serine protease, with antiviral activity. Upon administration, it binds to the HCV NS3/NS4A serine protease and prevents NS3/NS4A protease-mediated polyprotein maturation. This disrupts both the processing of viral proteins and the formation of the viral replication complex, thereby preventing viral replication and function. NS3, a serine protease, is essential for the proteolytic cleavage of multiple sites within the HCV polyprotein and plays a key role during HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) replication. NS4A is an activating factor for NS3. HCV is a small, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family; HCV infection is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

[131I-]	Iodide I-131 (as Sodium iodide I-131) is a radioisotopic drug used for the treatment and palliation of thyroid malignancy.  Iodine-131 is notable for causing mutation and death in cells that it penetrates, which is due to its mode of beta decay. As a result of beta decay, approximately 10% of its energy and radiation dose is via gamma radiation, while the other 90% (beta radiation) causes tissue damage without contributing to any ability to see or image the isotope. Low levels of beta radiation are also known for causing cancer as this dose is highly mutagenic. For this reason, less toxic iodine isotopes such as I-123 are more frequently used in nuclear imaging, while I-131 is reserved for its tissue destroying effects. Because the thyroid gland naturally takes up iodine from the body, therapeutic methods using radioisotopes can take advantage of this mechanism for localization of drug to the site of malignancy.   Therapeutic solutions of Sodium it are indicated for the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid carcinomas that take up iodine.  Palliative effects may be observed in patients with advanced thyroid malignancy if the metastatic lesions take up iodine.  It is also indicated for use in performance of the radioactive iodide (RAI) uptake test to evaluate thyroid function.
