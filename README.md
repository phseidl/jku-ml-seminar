# Seminar and Master's Thesis Repository

Meeting: every Monday 14-15:00 SP13 S318 or via [zoom](https://jku.zoom.us/j/98032906314?pwd=ZFRQVDA5UVU1T0d6U0R2eGljQjF3dz09)


This is the official repository for the seminar and master's thesis project, which encompasses two distinct groups: drug-discovery and EEG (Electroencephalography) research. This mono-repository is designed to facilitate coordination, version control, and collaboration between you all.

Most important thing:
your results should be reproducible and therefore well documented!

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the codebase and related resources for two parallel research streams:

1. **Drug Discovery**: 

2. **EEG (Electroencephalography) Research**: 

By maintaining a mono-repository, we aim to streamline collaboration and ensure consistent version control practices.

## Directory Structure

- `/drug-discovery`: Contains code, data, and resources for the drug-discovery group.
- `/eeg-research`: Contains code, data, and resources for the EEG research group.

Within the projects a suggestion would be:
- `*/individual/surname`: for your own stuff
- `*/external/`: for external repos
- `*/src/`: for shared source code
- `*/notebooks/`: for shared notebooks (or within your individual folder)
- `*/scripts/`: for scripts to run

-- 
please all try to mentain a README for both projects

each project should have a `setup.py` and a `env.yml`, I will provide a base, which you can modify.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phseidl/jku-ml-seminar23

2. Select a paper
Papers will be in a folder within the two groups in ````.*/data/papers/``, you can also propose your own paper for the seminar.

## Contributing

Each group is responsible for their own codebase and should follow their established contribution guidelines within their respective subdirectories.
Collaboration between groups is encouraged, and any cross-group collaboration should be discussed and documented.
Code Style
It's essential to maintain consistent coding and documentation standards within each group's codebase. Refer to the specific code style guidelines provided in your group's subdirectory.

## Version Control

We use Git for version control. Make sure to follow Git best practices, create branches for feature development or bug fixes, and use descriptive commit messages.

## Code Style

It's essential to maintain consistent coding and documentation standards within each group's codebase. Refer to the specific code style guidelines provided in your group's subdirectory.

## Communication

Preferably via github ;)

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS -- OPEN FOR SUGGESTIONS
